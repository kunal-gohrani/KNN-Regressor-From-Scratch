# KNN-Regressor-From-Scratch

This repository contains the source code of the KNN regressor that I built from scratch `KNearestRegressor.py`, and a tester file `KNeighborsTester.py` which uses `Train.csv` to test the model.

## Technologies Used:-

-   Python3.7
-   NumPy
-   Pandas
-   Scikit Learn (For splitting the data set into training and testing data, and for scaling the inputs)
